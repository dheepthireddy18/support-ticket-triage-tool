# support-ticket-triage-tool

## Project Overview

This Support Ticket Triage Tool is a command-line application that helps support teams identify urgent customer issues.
The tool will:
- Read support tickets from a CSV or JSON file.
- Validate incoming ticket records and flag invalid data.
- Assign priorities to valid tickets.
- Generate a daily summary report for support managers.

## Ticket Schema
|Field|Type|Description|Required|
|-----|----|-----------|--------|
|id|UUID|Unique identifier for each ticket|Yes|
|subject|String|Short summary of the customer's issue|Yes|
|body|String|Detailed description of the issue|Yes|
|customer|String| Customer name or identifier|Yes|
|created_at|ISO 8601 datetime|Date and time the ticket was created|Yes|


Example of a Ticket:
```
{
  "id": "e4eb2955-8d61-49a2-ac15-f016a366951a",
  "subject": "Unable to log in",
  "body": "The customer cannot log in after resetting their password.",
  "customer": "CUST-101",
  "created_at": "2026-10-19T08:30:00Z"
}
```

## Setup

Requires Python 3.10 or newer

```
git clone https://github.com/dheepthireddy18/support-ticket-triage-tool.git
cd support-ticket-triage-tool
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"         # installs the tool and pytest
```

## Running the Triage Tool

```
python -m ticket_triage --input data/sample_tickets.json
```

or 

```
ticket-triage --input data/sample_tickets.json --output reports/daily_summary.txt
```

After successfully running this command, the `reports/` folder is created automatically if it does not exist. A sample input file with five valid tickets and three invalid (missing customer, invalid date, duplicate id) is in `data/sample_tickets.json`.

## Running the Tests

```
pytest                              # all tests
pytest tests/test_integration.py -v # integration test only
```

The integration test runs the whole tool as a separate process on the sample
file and checks that the report is written and contains every valid ticket.

The test runs the tool as a separate process, so the project itself must be
installed first. This installs the `ticket_triage` package from `src/`.

```
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions:- (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs the full test suite on every
pull request and on pushes to `main`.
